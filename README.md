## What can it do? (About):

It's an addon that keeps your nodes centered around (0,0) automatically everytime you save or load a file! I don't know why that isn't default behavior, but now this addon exists luckily. I also added some extra feature thingies:

-If you have a node editor open, the viewport there will automatically pan together with the nodes, so they stay at the same place from your perspective and your workflow isn't interrupted!

-The nodes keep their offset to the underlying grid (It doesn't look like it because the grid you see in the editor is bigger than the actual snapping grid.), so if you snapped your nodes to the grid, they will keep that alignment.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

You need [Blender 4.2 or higher](https://blender.org) to install extensions. All operating systems are supported.

You can also install this addon like usual with lower versions, as it was tested with 3.6 - any version below is not tested but will probably still work.

You can learn more about the requirements under [Versions and compatibility](#versions-and-compatibility)

### Download
Head over to [Releases](https://github.com/MagnumVD/NodeVoidKeeper/releases) for a stable ZIP.  
Alternatively you can just download the [current source code](https://github.com/MagnumVD/NodeVoidKeeper/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) - it might not be bugfree, but you do get access to the latest features.

### Install the ZIP folder in Blender

Go to `Edit` -> `Preferences`. And select `Add-ons` in the left bar. Under the small arrow at the top right, click the `Install from Disk...` button.  
Select the ZIP file you just downloaded and click `Install from Disk`. After the
installation finishes, check the checkbox next to the `NodeVoidKeeper` addon.

## Versions and compatibility

### Blender versions
The addon was tested with the following blender versions:

* 3.6
* 4.2 
* 4.3 
* 4.4 
* 4.5

Custom blender forks probably work, I just didn't test them.
