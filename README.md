## What can it do? (About):

NodeVoidKeeper keeps your nodes centered around the Origin when saving or loading files.
That way your nodes won't slowly move into the infinite void of the canvas while you're working on them.
This makes file sharing a lot easier for the recipient end, and you won't see anything while working or saving your files - the movement is seamless.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

You need [Blender 4.2 or higher](https://blender.org) to install extensions. All operating systems are supported.

You can also install this addon like usual with lower versions, as it was tested with 3.6 - any version below is not tested but will probably still work.

You can learn more about the requirements under [Versions and compatibility](#versions-and-compatibility)

### Download
Head over to [Releases](https://github.com/MagnumVD/NodeVoidKeeper/releases) for a stable ZIP.  
Alternatively you can just download the [current source code](https://github.com/MagnumVD/NodeVoidKeeper/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) - it might not be bugfree, but you do get access to the latest features.

### Install the ZIP folder in Blender

Go to `Edit` -> `Preferences`. And select `Add-ons` in the left bar. Under the small arrow at the top right, click the `Install from Disk...` button.  
Select the ZIP file you just downloaded and click `Install from Disk`. After the
installation finishes, check the checkbox next to the `NodeVoidKeeper` addon.

## Versions and compatibility

### Blender versions
The addon was tested with the following blender versions:

* 3.6
* 4.2 
* 4.3 
* 4.4 

Custom blender forks probably work, I just didn't test them.
